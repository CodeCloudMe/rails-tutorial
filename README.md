## Bloccit: a Reddit clone to teach the fundamentals of web development and Rails 3

This is the first application that Bloc's web development apprentices will build. It's purpose is to provide a foundational understanding of full-stack web technologies required for any aspiring web developer.

This repository should be used as a reference only. Apprentices will build their own versions of Bloccit from scratch, with customizations and requirements discussed with their mentors.
